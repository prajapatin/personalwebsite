It is been long time I have written blogs and thought of restarting it after many years of pause. I am writing this first introductory blog after a long pause, I would be sharing my technical knowledge I acquired during my past working experience on this website.

I would appreciate if you can provide your comments on whatever subjects I would be sharing during subsequent days/months/years so that I can improve myself and share something back to community.

I would be using following source code format in my subsequent blogs:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

You can connect with me through [my linkedin profile][inprofile].
