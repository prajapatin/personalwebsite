<!-- <h2>Nilesh Prajapati</h2> -->

I believe the best technology leaders never stop exploring. My career has spanned the spectrum from the massive scale of Big Data and Cloud to the intelligent edge of IoT and IIoT. While my roots are in SOA and Microservices, my focus has shifted toward the frontier of **Agentic System Architecture** and **AI**. I am passionate about leveraging open-source innovation to build systems that are not just resilient, but truly autonomous.

As a **polyglot developer**, I refuse to be boxed into a single platform. Whether it is Python, Java, .NET, Node.js, or Blockchain, I choose the right tool for the job. This flexibility has allowed me to lead teams through complex legacy migrations and build cloud-native SaaS platforms from scratch.

For me, leadership is not about staying in the boardroom but it is about staying close to the code. I believe in building systems and building people.

**The Personal Side** I call Bangalore home, where I live with my wife, Mamata, and our children, Nishtha and Lakshya. When I am not at my desk, you will find me exploring the outdoors, visiting archaeological sites, relaxing at a hill station, or getting lost in a good audiobook. I have found that stepping away from technology is often the best way to gain a fresh perspective on it.
