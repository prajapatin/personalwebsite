<!-- <h2>Nilesh Prajapati</h2> -->

I am living in Bangalore with my lovely wife Mamata and two kids (Nishtha & Lakshya). I like travelling (particularly visiting natural places, archaeological sites, hill stations), reading, programming, playing with kids.

Professionally I am a Software Engineer and love designing, developing scalable & distributed software products. I have had a good fortune to work in various architecture patterns like SOA, Micro Services, Message Driven, Client-Server with on premise and cloud deployment model. I consider myself a polyglot developer and I do not restrict myself to specific technology or specific platform and due to that open mind, I have had an opportunity to architect large products with Microsoft.Net, Big data, Java, Node.js and other open source technologies.

Recently I have been working on IoT based platform with Microsoft Azure cloud and analytics technologies. I love learning from others and also enjoy sharing knowledge with others. You can connect with me regards to above mentioned technologies, architecture and I can share whatever I have learned and will definitely learn something from you as well.
